Through my time as a professional firefighter, Army officer, and business-owner, I developed and honed in on my talents of leadership, loyalty, and teamwork.  Web Development allows me to use my high attention for detail and creativity to help build innovative and pertinent web applications.</p>
                    <p>My family and I live on a 25 acre farm and raise nearly 20 animals.  The lifestyle and career path I have chosen are very different from each other.  The struggle is very real.  Having a remote development job is not a common thing where we live, but it gives me the balance I need to be successful at both.</p>
